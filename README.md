# Implementation details
## Responsive Design:  
- Custom breakpoints: Three breakpoints are extended through Tailwind configuration (mobile: 375px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1440px).  
- Fixed viewport width and height are set for different device sizes, with style adaptation using prefix classes like `mobile:`, `tablet:`, and `desktop:`.  

## Visual Design:  
- The background uses a gradient design (from light gray to dark gray).  
- User review content is displayed in a card component with rounded corners and a white background.  
- The Noto Sans font family is used for good readability.  

## Layout Structure:  
- The overall layout uses vertical centered flex layout.  
- Nested flex layouts inside the card display the avatar, username, and review content.  
- The review content is divided into a user information section and a text section.  

## Interactive Elements:  
- Copyright information and links (including project source and developer info) are at the bottom of the page.  
- Links use the `target="_blank"` attribute to ensure they open in new windows.  

## Technical Implementation:  
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling, reducing reliance on traditional CSS.  
- Google Fonts is integrated for more aesthetically pleasing fonts.  
- Placeholders are included for external style files (style.css) and script files (index.js).  

## Detail Handling:  
- The `object-cover` property is applied to avatar images to ensure proper display.  
- Usernames use bold and larger fonts, with an @ prefix added after the username.  
- The review text uses reasonable line height and color contrast.
